# The Aurorian
A Minecraft mod for 1.12.2 that adds a new dimension with new bosses, tools, and other neat items to use and explore.

Check [The Aurorian Discord](https://discord.gg/8tczsgx) for more information, changelogs, and other development stuff.

Also please note, I'm no expert when it comes to programming, source control, and other related stuff. And I am currently working on this project alone so there will be stuff I miss or stuff I do not do correctly. Also I wont always have time to work on stuff and there's a limit on what I can and know how to do. - Elise (Elseytd)
